# Simple Captcha Solver (Frontend Only)This project provides a basic frontend application to display and interact with captcha images. It's designed as a single-file HTML app using Tailwind CSS for responsiveness and styling.It defaults to a local `sample.png` image but can also load captcha images from a specified URL via a query parameter.## Features- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, mobile-friendly interface.- **Dynamic Image Loading**: Supports loading captcha images from an external URL using the `?url=` query parameter.- **Default Image**: If no `url` parameter is provided, it defaults to `sample.png`.- **Basic Verification**: For the `sample.png` image, it includes a hardcoded solution check. For dynamically loaded images, it simply acknowledges the user's input, as a true captcha solver requires server-side processing.## UsageTo use this application, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.### Default CaptchaWhen you open `index.html` without any query parameters, it will display `sample.png`:<pre><code>file:///path/to/your/project/index.html</code></pre>To solve the default captcha, enter `ADUR3` (case-insensitive) into the input field and click "Verify Captcha".### Loading an External Captcha ImageYou can specify an external image URL using the `url` query parameter. For example:Replace `https://example.com/your-captcha-image.png` with the actual URL of your captcha image.For external images, the system will only confirm that you've entered text; it cannot verify the correctness without a backend.## Limitations- **Client-Side Only**: This application runs entirely in the browser. It does not include any server-side logic required for true, robust captcha generation or AI-powered solving of arbitrary captcha images.- **Hardcoded Solution**: The verification for `sample.png` is based on a hardcoded string. This is for demonstration purposes only.- **No Bot Prevention**: As a frontend-only application, it cannot effectively prevent bots from interacting with forms; it's purely an interactive display for the user.## Technologies- HTML5- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)- JavaScript (ES6+)
